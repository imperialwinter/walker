Lynx designed this himself I believe. This is the second tier military upgrade for the Imperial flag (after the bunker).
I'll have to dig up more on what its intended features were besides increased metal income. It was definitely meant to
act as a commander unit. Here's the outline of the plan, basically:

-The Rebels would be able to build new Commander units (M-R-V or whatever we call it) which are pre-upgraded to build
all the high level units. These would also still qualify as commanders in Commander Death Ends games
-To balance, the Empire could upgrade flags to these Command posts. They would qualify as a commander in Comm Ends
and I think we planned on some other features. Probably some advanced radar or something like that.
