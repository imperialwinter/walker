-Command center (this was the one we planned on giving fake nukes right?)
-Ion cannon
-Shield generator
-In-flight air-repair plane, if spring permits it by then. Otherwise a pad of some sort

Graphics (not counting models)
-Reorganize /bitmaps/ directory. Delete unused textures, sort GPL textures elsewhere (if possible), and replace all GPL material in /bitmaps/ with custom content or otherwise licensed content (CC, PD, etc)

- add little blinking lights etc

-Create new CEGs particularly for unit deaths and various other explosions

uvwrapped and not skinned:
-Imp L2 sensor

Touchups or retextures:
-B-wing
-T4/c

Custom ground decals:
-Imperial barracks

Reflection maps and/or reflection map revisions:
-E-wing
-TIE defender (I think)
-Turbolaser
-T4/c
-ATPT

BOS scripts
-Investigate adding footstep sounds in conjunction with PLAY_SOUND and the global cob variables so the sounds don't stack too much

-Write new Killed() scripts for most non-infantry units

-Add sparks and other effects to the various factories, except the barracks for both sides

-Apply death animations to the rest of the rebel troops and the oddball imp troops (eweb, royal guard, rkt)

-Vehicle compatibility with the transports so things doesn't clip all too much

Audio
-Get some music made for us or find some fitting (and free) music to package in

-Remove clicks from any sounds we currently have in the game which we cannot yet replace

-Replace all sound effects and voice acks with new ones not stolen from OTA and/or force commander

-Edit the voice acks we currently have (cut them up into individual files, add radio noise etc)
-----END


Gnomre's comments on these, 20130801:
-"Groundscar" is Zsinj's term for the ground decal (for the adv air plant)
-AFAIK we never finalized a design for the MPTL. I think Jamin had a few designs but I don't know if we ever
agreed on one or if I received any of them
-Jedi/Sith should be shelved entirely. No work was done there
-AT-AT was just going to be delivered on the spot in a Theta dropship, no special gantry. It would probably
come with the later Commander upgrades (maybe the command post too?) and it should just allow you to "build" one
wherever you have LOS. You guys can work out the details
-I can't find the AT-AT skin yet but I'm pretty sure I have it. If not, I'll get a hold of Lynx.
-Bombardment uplink is uploaded to svn now. In OTA we just used Star Destroyer turbolasers fired from orbit in a
relatively large area. You can be creative with that if you want. Hell, you could make AT-ATs one of the upgrade
paths, and bombardment the other, then re-use this building for something else if you think of something.
-I think the air repair pad is already in the svn. If not bug me. It was going to be a first-tier flag upgrade iirc.

-Rebel command center: in TA, there are EMP and Neutron bomb weapons, which mass-stun and only kill Arm units
respectively. We were considering a consolidated building with several "nuke" options along these lines. We didn't
hammer out the specifics but they included things like a "Rogue Squadron assault" which would be a heavy bombing
run and/or specialized anti-resource-building weapons. Just think of Rebel guerilla warfare type things and not a
boring orbital bombardment for the Rebels.
-Ion cannon could be merged in as a command center bombardment though. We never made that unit and it was a pain in the
ass in OTA. It was basically a weird EMP Big Bertha.
-Shield generator might have been created and skinned. I'm not sure.
-In flight air-repair: our Rebel credos was mobility. Mobile commander, etc. We wanted the rebel air repair pad to be
the same. We had a working version of this in OTA but years ago the planes would just try to dock with themselves
in Spring and that didn't work too well. Either way a model and skin would need to be made.

-bitmaps dir is whatever at this point
-Zsinj always wanted more details like blinking lights and sound effects. I should have never made the droid lab.
-Ignore the Imp L2 sensor. Its role was merged into comm upgrades, and its model was made into the orbital uplink.
-I don't know if those reflection maps were ever made. I'll investigate.
