just including this from our private forum since I don't know if it ever got done:

---begin (from Zsinj)
note, work needs to be done on model/uv:
- the rear tracks have a UV issue
- the model needs to be broken up in preparation for animation
- the central horizontal cylinder that links the two semi-cylinders does not join the two, there is a big gap in between. That needs to be fixed.
- the tracks need to be animated

In terms of animation, I half imagined that when the thing is generating a shield, it might look good if the two semi-cylinders rotated in opposite directions, sort of like the Arm advanced radar. That may look crap though.

For the script, I think the unit needs to slow down by say, 25% when the shield is active. Start it's default velocity at about 1.9.
---end
