Ok, so we were repurposing the big ass advanced sensor facility into the Orbital Bombardment uplink. The Imperial
Commander and flag upgrades were going to take the place of a dedicated adv sensor.
The sp-sensoradv model is in the walker branch already but I don't know if it's different.
Internally, call it what you want. Apparently we've got about 3 different names for it. Pick one!
This was modelled by Zsinj (IIRC) and textured by Lynx
